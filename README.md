## 🛠️ Building and Testing

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/java.yml) for continuous integration. On every push or pull request to the `main` branch, the workflow:

- Sets up JDK 21 (Temurin)
- Compiles Java files in `src/main/java` (if present)
- Placeholder for running Java tests (customize as needed)

**Build Status:**  
[![Java CI](https://github.com/Abhishek-Atole/Java-Language/actions/workflows/java.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Abhishek-Atole/Java-Language/actions/workflows/java.yml)

**To build and run Java files locally:**

1. **Navigate to the source directory:**
   ```sh
   cd src/main/java
   ```
2. **Compile a Java file:**
   ```sh
   javac YourFileName.java
   ```
3. **Run the compiled program:**
   ```sh
   java YourFileName
   ```

> For projects using Maven or Gradle, refer to the respective `README.md` in the project folder.
